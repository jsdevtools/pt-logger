# @jestaubach/pt-logger
This library provides a logger that can be used in node applications to send logs to [Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com) and the console.

[@jestaubach/pt-logger](https://github.com/jsdevtools/pt-logger) provides both ESM and CommonJS interfaces.

The scaffolding for this project is adapted from [here](https://onderonur.netlify.app/blog/creating-a-typescript-library-with-vite/).
